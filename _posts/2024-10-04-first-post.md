# Welcome to my Blog
This is the first post of this blog, so far playing with Jekyll has been super fun!
while doing my research I found this theme and, honestly, I loved it. It allows for dark and light themes (although, who uses light theme..), is responsive, and the best thing about it, it didnt take 10 minutes to set up.

## Things im looking forward for:

- Integrating more advanced techniques to customize the sites
- Getting more familiar with Markdown
